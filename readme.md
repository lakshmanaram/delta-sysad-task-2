# delta-sysad-task-2
delta system administration profile inductions task 2 - python main script to create 2 other scripts and set up a cronjob
gets the location where the scripts are to be created as argument
eg: pyhton ./mainscript.py /home/user/Desktop
I have used MongoDB as the database and checked out the script in ubuntu 64 bit machine.
